abstract = {Preventing unauthorized downloading and other forms of digital piracy has been a persistent challenge. Strategies based on deterrence, ethical arguments, or technical measures have been effective, but only to a limited extent. The rising popularity of music streaming systems, however, affords the owners of digital content opportunities to experiment with alternative business models and value propositions that may also discourage digital piracy. The results of this field study involving 139 subjects suggest that music streaming systems that incorporate features that facilitate individual creativity and community building contributes towards the enjoyment and usefulness of the system. This in turn leads to music streaming adoption. The results of the study also show that the usefulness of a music streaming system is associated with a reduction in pirating intention. Surprisingly, a link between the enjoyment of a music streaming system and a reduction in digital pirating intention was not supported.},

abstract = {Spotify is a commercial music streaming service providing music content from a range of major and independent record labels. Spotify users can either subscribe to a "Freemium" model supported by advertisements or they can pay a premium to access additional features without advertisements. Since its inception in 2008, users of this service have totaled twenty million, five million of them paying monthly fees of either US{\$}4.99 or {\$}9.99. Prominent artists such as Taylor Swift and The Black Keys have begun speaking out about this service, some even withholding their music from the service entirely, explaining that the payment model is unfair and that the service is cannibalizing album sales. Other artists praise the service for its ability to deliver a legal alternative to piracy, where artists can capture valuable information about their listeners and are compensated on a per-play basis. Whether we like it or not, Spotify and related music streaming services represent a window into the future of the music industry. This study investigates the perceptions of streaming services like Spotify from the perspective of all parties involved: music industry professionals, artists, and consumers in order to identify perceived needs and positive developments. The conclusion offers suggestions for the future role of streaming services in the music industry based on the survey and interview results. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

This article explores how artists performing at a large music festival in Norway were streamed before, during, and after the festival over the course of four different years. The data shows that festival streams grew by more than 40{\%} compared to control weeks and were particularly pronounced among users who lived near the venue. The article then argues that changes in listening patterns may reflect a more general shift towards the " eventization " of streaming media.},

abstract = {Streaming is becoming the most common format from which people access, share and listen to music and it is suggested that such practices are indicative of a shift towards a ‘post-ownership' economy. In the case of music, consumers may place greater value (emotional and monetary) on the physical product because of the lack of legal ownership and/or absence of perceived ownership associated with streaming. This article examines how experiences of ownership are articulated through music streaming formats via qualitative interviews and an online themed discussion group. Drawing from psychological ownership theory we identify motivations (place, identity and control), antecedents (investing the self, coming to intimately know the target, pride and controlling the target) and outcomes (loyalty, empowerment and social rewards) of psychological ownership that are evident in the consumers' experiences of music streaming. This has theoretical and managerial implications for our understanding of how consumers engage with the post-ownership economy.},

Services such as Spotify and Deezer are widely expected to become the dominant means of mass music consumption in the future and have been significant factors in helping recording industries in some countries arrest their long-term decline. The emergence of such services (especially the largest of them, Spotify) has caused controversy, however, with both major stars and smaller independent artists publicly criticising the low levels of royalty payments such services have thus far generated. This paper provides an overview of the controversy, concentrating on the criticisms of Spotify from independent labels and musicians. In such a rapidly moving sector, it is unwise to offer any definitive predictions and thus the purpose of this paper is to outline as clearly as possible the parameters of the current debate.

In this paper, we study how the adoption of music streaming affects listening behavior. Using a unique panel data set of individual consumers' listening histories across many digital music platforms, adoption of streaming leads to very large increases in quantity and diversity of consumption in the first months after adoption. Although the effects attenuate over time, even after half of a year, adopters play substantially more, and more diverse, music. Relative to music ownership where experimentation is expensive, adoption of streaming increases new music discovery. While repeat listening to new music decreases, users' best discoveries have higher play-rates. We discuss the implications for consumers and producers of music. },

Notwithstanding the complications intrinsic to this provision, the Act stopped short of creating a compulsory license for interactive and on demand services. Streaming services like Spotify, Rdio and now Google Play All-Access are transforming music distribution. Yet these companies are subject to a rate-hike cliff, whereby labels and copyright owners can license content to upstart distributors for relatively little compensation, only to subsequently raise these rates as distributional platforms begin to become profitable. To combat this phenomenon, a compulsory rate should be extended to interactive digital webcasters, and should be structured so as to incentivize both parties to negotiate for a fair rate, outside of the compulsory one.},

This massive change in the radio industry says something about the demand for such shows, but attributing the rise of talk radio to a corresponding rise in conservative popular opinion is misleading. We argue that this remarkable growth is better explained by the collision of two changes that have transformed the radio business: deregulation and the mainstreaming of digital music technologies. Regulatory changes have shifted much of radio production and control from local to mass production (managed by industry giants such as Clear Channel Communications) and created a context ripe for nationally syndicated hosts such as Rush Limbaugh, Glenn Beck, and Mark Levin. Meanwhile, rapid technological changes have given consumers more control over the way they listen to music. Technologies such as MP₃ players, Internet radio, smart phones, and Pandora Radio have made it more difficult for stations with a music format to be profitable. As music programming has become more problematic, many stations have developed a highly successful business model by converting to talk formats airing nationally syndicated shows.},

abstract = {On-demand streaming services that rely on subscription fees or advertising as a revenue source (e.g., Spotify) are a topic of ongoing controversial debate in the music industry because their addition to the distribution mix entails the risk of cannibalization of other distribution channels (e.g., purchases of downloads or CDs) and might reduce overall revenues. To date, no research has assessed the effect of streaming services on revenue, and whether cannibalization indeed takes place. Our research fills this void and assesses the impact of free and paid streaming services on music expenditures and on total music industry revenue. To this end, we constructed a research design in which we observed a panel of more than 2500 music consumers repeatedly over more than one year. This approach allows us to eliminate individual-specific unobserved effects that may otherwise confound the identification of a cannibalization effect. Our results show that the adoption of a free streaming service as well as the adoption of a paid streaming service cannibalizes consumers' music expenditures. The net effect of paid streaming services on revenue, however, is clearly net positive. In contrast, the net effect of free streaming services on revenue is only positive for consumers who were relatively inactive before the adoption. On the industry level, our findings suggest that the negative effect of free streaming on industry revenue is offset by the positive effect of paid streaming in the context that we analyze. Hence, in the market that we study and under the assumptions that we make, we estimate that the overall effect of streaming on industry revenue is positive.},

We examine the differences in these gratifications between the basic and premium users with data from 374 Spotify users. The results demonstrate that enjoyment, discovering new music, and ubiquity, are the main drivers of the continuance intention. Interestingly, social connectivity has no effect on continuance intention. Furthermore, premium users experience higher levels of enjoyment and ubiquity than the non-paying basic users. Finally, enjoyment is the only predictor of continuance intention among basic users, but has no effect among premium users.},

abstract = {Streaming music services have exploded in popularity in the past few years, variously raising optimism and concern about their impacts on recorded music revenue. On the one hand, streaming services allow sellers to engage in bundling with the promise of increasing revenues, profits, and consumer surplus. Successful bundling would indeed translate some of the interest in music not generating revenue through individual track sales - unpaid consumption and deadweight loss - into willingness to pay for the bundled offering. On the other hand, streaming may displace traditional individual track sales. Even if they displace sales, streams may however still raise overall revenue if the streaming payment is large enough in relation to the extent of sales displacement. We make use of the growth in Spotify use during the years 2013-2015 to measure its impact on unpaid consumption and on the sales of recorded music. We find that Spotify use displaces permanent downloads. In particular, 137 Spotify streams appear to reduce track sales by 1 unit. Consistent with the existing literature, our analysis also shows that Spotify displaces music piracy. Given the current industry's revenue from track sales ({\$}0.82 per sale) and the average payment received per stream ({\$}0.007 per stream), our sales displacement estimates show that the losses from displaced sales are roughly outweighed by the gains in streaming revenue. In other words, our analysis shows that interactive streaming appears to be revenue-neutral for the recorded music industry. Luis},

abstract = {Previous studies examining the intention and level of music piracy among young people have postulated that collective attitudes, optimistic biases toward risk, and beliefs about copyright laws are the key factors involved in their decisions. We extend the analysis by studying the impact of music streaming services. Music streaming is an alternative business model in which, for a small fee, the consumer has access to a large set of songs without downloading them onto their devices. Results from a Logit model show that college students who are frequent users of music streaming are also more likely to download music illegally. A plausible explanation is that those engaged in music streaming are also heavy users of computer technology, software downloading, and digital sharing - factors that facilitate the conditions for music piracy. Demographics, collective attitudes, and beliefs about risk and rewards continue to play a key role in explaining music piracy, but their relevance is slightly reduced once controlled for music streaming usage.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 IEEE. Music streaming platforms enable people to access millions of tracks using computers and mobile devices. The latter allow users consume different music during different activities. Both, the sheer amount of music and the mobile access to music makes music organization an interesting topic for multimedia researchers. Assisting users to organize their music and make the music they like easily available in the right moment, contributes to increased usability of music streaming platforms. To get a deeper understanding of how users organize music nowadays, we analyze user-created playlists crawled from the music streaming platform Spotify. Using this new data set we find an explanation of differences in the playlists using audio features and based on this compute playlist clusters. We find that 91{\%} of all users create at least one playlist in the "feel good music"-cluster and classical music or rap music can be considered as niche music with respect to the number of playlists, however not as niche music when considering the number of users. To foster research in this field, we make our analysis tool publicly available.},

Given that the media industries, as any other industry, can be defined as a set of markets, one of which is the leading market, and to which other markets are auxiliary, the question asked is what market is leading in the case of Spotify. What the article describes as the ?Spotify effect? is the company?s ability to fold markets into each other: to make disappear an aggressive financial growth strategy and business set-up based on ad tech engineering by creating an aura of Nordic cool and public benefit around its use of music.

The service currently has a user base of over 7 million and has been available in six European countries since October 2008. Data collected indicates that the combination of the client-server and peer-to-peer paradigms can be applied to music streaming with good results. In particular, 8.8{\%} of music data played comes from Spotify's servers while the median playback latency is only 265 ms (including cached tracks). We also discuss the user access patterns observed and how the peer-to-peer network affects the access patterns as they reach the server.},

Unfortunately, many of these literatures have talked past, rather than to, each other. This paper develops an analysis of trust in economic activity through a dialogue between the disciplines of economics and sociology. It outlines the relationship of trust to economic co-operation and identifies a number of types of trust. The potential benefits of these different types of trust to advanced capitalist economies are identified. Consideration is given to the processes of trust creation and destruction in market economies. Particular emphasis here is on how far trust can be symbiotic with, or contradictory to, power and the market. With an analysis of the key properties of individual agents which make them more or less prone to trusting behaviour, the paper is then able to identify the critical factors likely to underlie high-trust and low-trust economies. This has important public policy implications given the potential benefits which trust can have for advanced economies.},

Musicream facilitates active, flex- ible, and unexpected encounters with musical pieces by providing four functions: the music-disc streaming func- tion which creates a flow of many musical-piece enti- ties (discs) from a (huge) music collection, the similarity- based sticking function which allows a user to easily pick out and listen to similar pieces from the flow, the meta- playlist function which can generate a playlist of playlists (ordered lists of pieces) while editing them with a high degree of freedom, and the time-machine function which automatically records all Musicream activities and allows a user to visit and retrieve a past state as if using a time machine. In our experiments, these functions were used seamlessly to achieve active and creative querying and browsing of music collections, confirming the effective- ness of Musicream.},

In this paper, we study how the adoption of music streaming affects listening behavior. Using a unique panel data set of individual consumers' listening histories across many digital music platforms, adoption of streaming leads to very large increases in quantity and diversity of consumption in the first months after adoption. Although the effects attenuate over time, even after half of a year, adopters play substantially more, and more diverse, music. Relative to music ownership where experimentation is expensive, adoption of streaming increases new music discovery. While repeat listening to new music decreases, users' best discoveries have higher play-rates. We discuss the implications for consumers and producers of music. },

abstract = {User participation has transformed the way news travel the globe. With the rise of the 'Web 2.0' phenomenon users have been empowered with the means of creating and distributing informational items, which we call social feeds. Platforms like Twitter and Facebook provide a variety of tools to facilitate real-time communication among people. But social sites are not limited to personal chat; they also provide an effective means for organizing large groups of people in response to catastrophic disasters. Monitoring these feeds can provide time-critical information, but can easily lead to information overload due to the large amount of data being shared. In this paper we introduce a mobile auditory display application called AudioFeeds that allows users to maintain an overview of activities in different social feeds. AudioFeeds runs on a mobile device and enables users to get an overview of their social networks and spot peaks in activity by sonifying social feeds and creating a spatialised soundscape around the user's head. We conducted a user study looking into different aspects of activity monitoring. Results show that our application provides an effective way for monitoring overall activity levels and allows users to identify activity peaks with 86.1{\%} accuracy even when mobile. {\textcopyright} 2010 ACM.},

Channel bandwidth remains a bottleneck commonly addressed with lossy compression schemes for both the video and audio streams. Anecdotal evidence suggests a strongly perceived link between bit rate and quality. This paper presents three audio quality listening experiments using the ITU MUSHRA methodology to assess a number of audio codecs typically used by streaming services. They were assessed for a range of bit rates using three presentation modes: consumer and studio quality headphones and loudspeakers. Our results indicate that with consumer quality headphones, listeners were not differentiating between codecs with bit rates greater than 48 kb/s (p{\textgreater}=0.228). For studio quality headphones and loudspeakers aac-lc at 128 kb/s and higher was differentiated over other codecs (p{\textless}=0.001). The results provide insights into quality of experience that will guide future development of objective audio quality metrics.},

abstract = {In the Internet music scene, where recommendation technology is key for navigating huge collections, large market players enjoy a considerable advantage. Accessing a wider pool of user feedback leads to an increasingly more accurate analysis of user tastes, effectively creating a "rich get richer" effect. This work aims at significantly lowering the entry barrier for creating music recommenders, through a paradigm coupling a public data source and a new collaborative filtering (CF) model. We claim that Internet radio stations form a readily available resource of abundant fresh human signals on music through their playlists, which are essentially cohesive sets of related tracks. In a way, our models rely on the knowledge of a diverse group of experts in lieu of the commonly used wisdom of crowds. Over several weeks, we aggregated publicly available playlists of thousands of Internet radio stations, resulting in a dataset encompassing millions of plays, and hundreds of thousands of tracks and artists. This provides the large scale ground data necessary to mitigate the cold start problem of new items at both mature and emerging services. Furthermore, we developed a new probabilistic CF model, tailored to the Internet radio resource. The success of the model was empirically validated on the collected dataset. Moreover, we tested the model at a cross-source transfer learning manner - the same model trained on the Internet radio data was used to predict behavior of Yahoo! Music users. This demonstrates the ability to tap the Internet radio signals in other music recommendation setups. Based on encouraging empirical results, our hope is that the proposed paradigm will make quality music recommendation accessible to all interested parties in the community.},

This paper ex- plores streaming from a psychological perspective, and highlights a range of factors that motivate users to favour access over ownership. From removal of responsibili- ties of ownership to enhanced discovery, nostalgia-fulfilment to augmented emo- tional engagement, adoption of access-based consumption is shown to be both driven by, and have multiple positive effects on listeners' psychological functioning. The paper concludes by examining some implications of the issues discussed for each of the three pillars of the streaming industry — listeners, content-creators and service providers — for enhancing the musical experience, growing revenues, and maximising overall potential for engagement with and through music.},

abstract = {Streaming music services have exploded in popularity in the past few years, variously raising optimism and concern about their impacts on recorded music revenue. On the one hand, streaming services allow sellers to engage in bundling with the promise of increasing revenues, profits, and consumer surplus. Successful bundling would indeed translate some of the interest in music not generating revenue through individual track sales - unpaid consumption and deadweight loss - into willingness to pay for the bundled offering. On the other hand, streaming may displace traditional individual track sales. Even if they displace sales, streams may however still raise overall revenue if the streaming payment is large enough in relation to the extent of sales displacement. We make use of the growth in Spotify use during the years 2013-2015 to measure its impact on unpaid consumption and on the sales of recorded music. We find that Spotify use displaces permanent downloads. In particular, 137 Spotify streams appear to reduce track sales by 1 unit. Consistent with the existing literature, our analysis also shows that Spotify displaces music piracy. Given the current industry's revenue from track sales ({\$}0.82 per sale) and the average payment received per stream ({\$}0.007 per stream), our sales displacement estimates show that the losses from displaced sales are roughly outweighed by the gains in streaming revenue. In other words, our analysis shows that interactive streaming appears to be revenue-neutral for the recorded music industry. Luis},

Over the last few years, this has significantly improved making monetization of streaming, possible. Recently, there has been an explosion of commercial video delivery services over the Internet, sometimes referred to as over-the-top (OTT) delivery. All these services invariably use streaming technologies. Initially, streaming had all the promise, then for a long time, it was download and play, later progressive download for short content, and now it is streaming again. Did streaming win the download versus streaming contest? Did the best technology win? The improvement in streaming experience has been possible through a variety of new streaming technologies, some proprietary and others extensions to standard protocols. The primary delivery mechanism for entertainment video, both premium content like movies and user generated content (UGC), tends to be HTTP streaming. Is HTTP streaming the panacea for all problems? The goal of this article is to give an industry perspective of what fundamentally changed in video streaming that makes it commercially viable now. This article outlines how a blend of technology choices between download and streaming makes the current wave of ubiquitous streaming possible for entertainment video delivery. After identifying problems that still need to be solved, the article concludes with the lessons learnt from the video streaming evolution.},

The current research examines music consumption preferences in this new context. In order to break with the outmoded free-illegal versus paid-legal dichotomy, the present research studies consumer preferences for a broader range of music platform attributes, including free versus paying business models, (il)legality of use, artist revenues, downloading versus streaming, and audio quality. Based on a literature review and a qualitative study with in-depth interviews (N = 92), an online conjoint survey (N = 764) quantifies online music preferences. Results show that consumers of all ages clearly and consistently prefer legal and ethical options if available, but favor different ways of making this economically viable. Youngsters and young adults are more open to advertising, while middle-aged adults are more often willing to pay for advertising-free platforms. Thus, in real-life choices, youngsters may appear to be less ethical and law abiding, but the driving force behind this is mainly economical. Finally, a market segmentation provides deeper insights into online music consumer preferences and leads to recommendations on how to define viable legal and ethical music offerings.},

abstract = {Objective: Research has shown that fixed-split, ergonomic keyboards lessen the pain and functional status in symptomatic individuals as well as reduce the likelihood of developing musculoskeletal disorders in asymptomatic typists over extended use. The goal of this study was to evaluate design features to determine whether the current fixed-split ergonomic keyboard design could be improved. Participants: Thirty-nine, adult-aged, fixed-split ergonomic keyboard users were recruited to participate in one of three studies. Methods: First utilizing non-functional models and later a functional prototype, three studies evaluated keyboard design features including: 1) keyboard lateral inclination, 2) wrist rest height, 3) keyboard slope, and 4) curved "gull-wing" key layouts. Results: The findings indicated that keyboard lateral inclination could be increased from 8° to 14°; wrist rest height could be increased up to 10 mm from current setting; positive, flat, and negative slope settings were equally preferred and facilitated greater postural variation; and participants preferred a new gull-wing key layout. The design changes reduced forearm pronation and wrist extension while not adversely affecting typing performance. Conclusions: This research demonstrated how iterative-evaluative, user-centered research methods can be utilized to improve a product's design such as a fixed-split ergonomic keyboard. {\textcopyright} 2010 - IOS Press and the authors.

abstract = {Spotify is a commercial music streaming service providing music content from a range of major and independent record labels. Spotify users can either subscribe to a "Freemium" model supported by advertisements or they can pay a premium to access additional features without advertisements. Since its inception in 2008, users of this service have totaled twenty million, five million of them paying monthly fees of either US{\$}4.99 or {\$}9.99. Prominent artists such as Taylor Swift and The Black Keys have begun speaking out about this service, some even withholding their music from the service entirely, explaining that the payment model is unfair and that the service is cannibalizing album sales. Other artists praise the service for its ability to deliver a legal alternative to piracy, where artists can capture valuable information about their listeners and are compensated on a per-play basis. Whether we like it or not, Spotify and related music streaming services represent a window into the future of the music industry. This study investigates the perceptions of streaming services like Spotify from the perspective of all parties involved: music industry professionals, artists, and consumers in order to identify perceived needs and positive developments. The conclusion offers suggestions for the future role of streaming services in the music industry based on the survey and interview results. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract = {There has been a considerable rise in discourses concerning trust from a range of academic disciplines and perspectives. Unfortunately, many of these literatures have talked past, rather than to, each other. This paper develops an analysis of trust in economic activity through a dialogue between the disciplines of economics and sociology. It outlines the relationship of trust to economic co-operation and identifies a number of types of trust. The potential benefits of these different types of trust to advanced capitalist economies are identified. Consideration is given to the processes of trust creation and destruction in market economies. Particular emphasis here is on how far trust can be symbiotic with, or contradictory to, power and the market. With an analysis of the key properties of individual agents which make them more or less prone to trusting behaviour, the paper is then able to identify the critical factors likely to underlie high-trust and low-trust economies. This has important public policy implications given the potential benefits which trust can have for advanced economies.},

Musicream facilitates active, flex- ible, and unexpected encounters with musical pieces by providing four functions: the music-disc streaming func- tion which creates a flow of many musical-piece enti- ties (discs) from a (huge) music collection, the similarity- based sticking function which allows a user to easily pick out and listen to similar pieces from the flow, the meta- playlist function which can generate a playlist of playlists (ordered lists of pieces) while editing them with a high degree of freedom, and the time-machine function which automatically records all Musicream activities and allows a user to visit and retrieve a past state as if using a time machine. In our experiments, these functions were used seamlessly to achieve active and creative querying and browsing of music collections, confirming the effective- ness of Musicream.},

We hypothesize that the more popular artists provide context for introducing new music by more obscure local artists.

Finally, we describe an interactive map that features personalized event recommendations based on the user's listening history.

We extend the analysis by studying the impact of music streaming services. Music streaming is an alternative business model in which, for a small fee, the consumer has access to a large set of songs without downloading them onto their devices. Results from a Logit model show that college students who are frequent users of music streaming are also more likely to download music illegally. A plausible explanation is that those engaged in music streaming are also heavy users of computer technology, software downloading, and digital sharing - factors that facilitate the conditions for music piracy. Demographics, collective attitudes, and beliefs about risk and rewards continue to play a key role in explaining music piracy, but their relevance is slightly reduced once controlled for music streaming usage.},

Notwithstanding the complications intrinsic to this provision, the Act stopped short of creating a compulsory license for interactive and on demand services. Streaming services like Spotify, Rdio and now Google Play All-Access are transforming music distribution. Yet these companies are subject to a rate-hike cliff, whereby labels and copyright owners can license content to upstart distributors for relatively little compensation, only to subsequently raise these rates as distributional platforms begin to become profitable. To combat this phenomenon, a compulsory rate should be extended to interactive digital webcasters, and should be structured so as to incentivize both parties to negotiate for a fair rate, outside of the compulsory one.},

Providing more user control is interesting to enable end-users to help steer the recommendation process with additional input and feedback. However, different users may have different preferences with regard to such control. To the best of our knowledge, no research has investigated the effect of personal characteristics on visual control techniques in the music recommendation domain. In this paper, we present results of a user study on the web using two different visualisation techniques (a radar chart and sliders) that allows users to control Spotify recommendations. A within-subject design with Latin Square counterbalancing measures was used for the study. Results indicate that the radar chart helped the participants discover a significantly higher number of new songs compared to the sliders. We also found that users' experience with Spotify had an influence on their interaction with different musical attributes. The participants who used Spotify frequently and users with a high individual musical sophistication interacted with the attributes significantly more with the radar chart compared to the sliders. Individual musical sophistication also had a significant impact on their interaction with the interaction techniques. The participants with high musical sophistication interacted significantly more with the radar chart in comparison to the sliders. Based on the feedback from our participants, we provide design suggestions to further improve user control in music recommendation.},

abstract = {In this work, we offer a novel system, MicroStation ($\mu$Station) that allows ubiquitous data broadcasting applications using the FM radio on mobile devices such as smartphones. $\mu$Station includes two key modules to enable data broadcasting based on existing mobile FM radio hardware. Channel Selector assigns different FM channels to neighboring $\mu$Station broadcasters to avoid collision and guides $\mu$Station listeners to find their broadcasting of interest. Data Codec realizes bit-level communication between mobile devices through existing FM radio hardware. We describe an implementation of $\mu$Station on the Nokia N900 smartphone, and provide low-level APIs and services to support application development. We also demonstrate two representative applications: Facebook-FM and Sync-Flash. These applications demonstrate the capability of $\mu$Station to readily enable a new class of ubiquitous data broadcasting applications on mobile devices. {\textcopyright} 2011 ACM.},

abstract = {Organizations deploy advanced communication media such as audio and videoconferencing to enhance and extend group communication interactions. However, established groups (i.e., groups with a history of working together) can view and use the same technology differently from groups without any past experiences of working together. This study examines the relative influences of media condition and group cohesion on social presence, task participation, and group consensus. Results from a controlled laboratory experiment with 45 triads of college students working on a decision-making task showed that media condition (audio conferencing vs. desktop video-conferencing) has significantly smaller influences on social presence and task participation than group cohesion in established groups. The study found that influence of group cohesion over social presence is additive, rather than substitutive, to that of media condition. The study also established that task participation played a more important role than social presence in determining the degree of consensus among group members in computer-mediated communication environments.},

abstract = {Digital technology reveals new perspectives on the nature and potentialities of our original broadcast medium. Whilst confusing our attempts to define radio it heightens our awareness of the qualities, which, apparently independently of platform, continue to make radio such a durable form of public communication. This article argues that, paradoxically, the 'narrowcast' and 'on demand' characteristics of Internet transmission, far from being remote from 'real radio' in fact open up new spaces in which one of its earliest recognized, inspirational qualities can be revitalized: that of the listener's sense of tuning into an ongoing, dynamic conversation - broadly defined. Scannell's phenomenological approach is helpful in the elucidation of this quality. The economics of filling airtime under today's broadcast license regimes, together with the availability of automating production technology, threatens to steer a large section of popular radio away from such a cultural conversation and towards closer integration with the interests of the mainstream music industry. Case studies show how combining automation tools with the non-time-limited, on-demand resources of the Internet is starting to create an architecture through which a version of the dream of radio as public conversation might be re-envisioned.},

abstract = {Streaming is becoming the most common format from which people access, share and listen to music and it is suggested that such practices are indicative of a shift towards a ‘post-ownership' economy. In the case of music, consumers may place greater value (emotional and monetary) on the physical product because of the lack of legal ownership and/or absence of perceived ownership associated with streaming. This article examines how experiences of ownership are articulated through music streaming formats via qualitative interviews and an online themed discussion group. Drawing from psychological ownership theory we identify motivations (place, identity and control), antecedents (investing the self, coming to intimately know the target, pride and controlling the target) and outcomes (loyalty, empowerment and social rewards) of psychological ownership that are evident in the consumers' experiences of music streaming. This has theoretical and managerial implications for our understanding of how consumers engage with the post-ownership economy.},

Specialized units such as critical care require multidisciplinary care where perception about every members role may affect the delivery of patient care. The objective of this study was to find out nurses' perceptions of the role of physiotherapists in the critical care team. METHODS:: Qualitative study by using semi-structured interview was conducted among the qualified nurses working in the Intensive Care Unit of a tertiary care hospital. The interview consisted of 19 questions divided into 3 sections. Interviews were audio recorded and transcribed. In-depth content analysis was carried out to identify major themes in relation to the research question. RESULTS:: Analysis identified five major issues which included role and image of a physiotherapist, effectiveness of treatment, communications, teamwork, and interprofessional relations. Physiotherapists were perceived to be an important member of the critical team with the role of mobilizing the patients. The respondents admitted that there existed limitations in interprofessional relationship. CONCLUSION:: Nurses perceived the role of physiotherapist in the critical care unit as an integral part and agreed on the need for inclusion of therapist multidisciplinary critical care team.},

The stepwise regression analysis converged on a three–predictor model revealing that social presence (the degree to which a person is perceived as “real” in mediated communication), student perception of having equal opportunity to participate, and technical skills accounted for about 68{\%} of the explained variance. Social presence alone contributed about 60{\%} of this variance, suggesting that it may be a very strong predictor of satisfaction. Reliability data on the social presence scale is provided. The results also indicated that participants who felt a higher sense of social presence enhanced their socio–emotional experience by using emoticons to express missing nonverbal cues in written form.

@book{Beaudouin-Lafon2006,
abstract = {Human-computer interaction (HCI) is a multidisciplinary field "concerned with the design, evaluation and implementation of interactive computing systems for human use and with the study of major phenomena surrounding them" [24]. A human-computer system1 is typically made up of two components: the user interface and the functional core. The user interface captures user input and turns it into calls to the functional core, which typically implements the algorithmic component of the system. The user interface also turns the results of its calls to the functional core into output to be presented to the user. A human-computer system therefore interacts with its user(s) through its user interface. Human-computer systems are arguably the first truly interactive systems. In 1963, Ivan Sutherland's SketchPad [48] was the first system to use pen input on a CRT display, pioneering direct manipulation techniques that are still in use today. Forty years later, millions of people interact with graphical user interfaces on daily basis, to the point where computers are often reduced to their input-output devices and applications to their user interface. Yet human-computer systems are still created at great cost with algorithmic approaches. More than a decade ago, a study showed that on average 50{\%} of the development cost of human-computer systems is spent on the user interface [37]. One of the main reasons was the lack of proper tools to develop such interfaces, their growing complexity and the inability to test them thoroughly. There is no reason to believe that the situation has changed substantially since then because the tools in use today are based on the same concepts as twenty years ago. User interfaces are notoriously difficult to program, debug and maintain because they exacerbate many aspects of interactive systems. For example, traditional interactive systems, i.e., systems that interact with other computer systems, often rely on well-specified protocols so that it is fairly easy to anticipate future possible inputs. uman-computer systems, for they have a human in the loop, cannot rely on such strict protocols. In order to give the user a sense of control, they must be prepared to receive virtually any input at any moment, and react to it in a way that will be understandable to the user. Therefore the state space of a human-computer system is extremely large. This chapter evaluates some unique aspects of human-computer systems with respect to the five characteristics of interactive systems outlined in the preface of this book: • Nonalgorithmic computational problem: human-computer systems are often created by turning an algorithmic system into an interactive one in order to give the users more control over the process; at the same time, many human-computer systems are not meant to solve a particular algorithmic problem but instead to extend human capabilities in order to address more open-ended situations. • Dynamic interleaving of user input and system output streams: human- computer systems feature intricate dependencie between input and output streams, with tight timing constraints and large abstraction mismatches between user, streams and computer. • Dependency on the environment: the evolution towards novel forms of interaction, such as ubiquitous and pervasive computing, mixed and augmented reality, and tangible interfaces, extends the environment of human- computer systems to the physical world and blurs the distinction between physical and digital artifacts. • Parallel "computation" of user and computer : the unique characteristics of human users as well as the distributed nature of many interfaces require multiple threads and various levels of parallelism and synchronization between user and computer. • Noncomputability of the environment : humans are inherently noncomputable, but the learning and adaptation capabilities of users and computers can be leveraged to create more powerful human-computer systems. The chapter covers a wide range of user interface styles and techniques, from traditional graphical user interf ces to advanced research, and considers the full life-cycle of human-computer systems from design to evaluation. {\textcopyright} 2006 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract = {Many studies have sought to understand the behavior of music listeners to design an improved music listening experience. This is especially important in music recommendation systems in that listening behavior can directly relate to the purpose of the system. For example, a listener who likes to discover new music will be more satisfied with a list of suggestions that present different types of music, while others prefer to listen to their same old music and artists. Previous research has focused on performing user research to explicitly extract information about listening behavior but few studies have attempted a data-driven approach to suggest listener personas or groups. In this study, we applied two clustering methods to user playrate distribution data to see if meaningful user clusters appear, and performed analysis on the results by comparing the patterns of the result clusters with the major characteristics of listener groups derived from previous user researches. Our experiments show that two large clusters and two small clusters are formed, with each cluster representing an intuitive difference in terms of listening behavior.},

Using a logit model, we found that streaming complements piracy, providing evidence that these two modes of music consumption will coexist in the market. In addition, we found that social and peer behavior, risk perceptions, and consumption time online are elements contributing to music piracy.},

However, such interfaces face a number of challenges when supporting multiple and simultaneous tasks, namely: 1) interference amongst multiple audio streams, and 2) the constraints of cognitive load. We present a comparative study of spatial audio techniques evaluated in a divided- and selective-attention task. A podcast was used for high cognitive load (divided-attention) and classical music for low cognitive load (selective-attention), while interacting with an audio menu. Results showed that spatial audio techniques were preferred when cognitive load was kept low, while a baseline technique using an interruptible single audio stream was significantly less preferred. Conversely, when cognitive load was increased the preferences reversed. Thus, given an appropriate task structure, spatial techniques offer a means of designing effective audio interfaces to support eyes-free mobile multitasking. Copyright 2011 ACM.},

abstract = {The number of radio stations airing political talk shows— predominantly conservative talk radio— has surged in the past few years. This massive change in the radio industry says something about the demand for such shows, but attributing the rise of talk radio to a corresponding rise in conservative popular opinion is misleading. We argue that this remarkable growth is better explained by the collision of two changes that have transformed the radio business: deregulation and the mainstreaming of digital music technologies. Regulatory changes have shifted much of radio production and control from local to mass production (managed by industry giants such as Clear Channel Communications) and created a context ripe for nationally syndicated hosts such as Rush Limbaugh, Glenn Beck, and Mark Levin. Meanwhile, rapid technological changes have given consumers more control over the way they listen to music. Technologies such as MP₃ players, Internet radio, smart phones, and Pandora Radio have made it more difficult for stations with a music format to be profitable. As music programming has become more problematic, many stations have developed a highly successful business model by converting to talk formats airing nationally syndicated shows.},

abstract = {On-demand streaming services that rely on subscription fees or advertising as a revenue source (e.g., Spotify) are a topic of ongoing controversial debate in the music industry because their addition to the distribution mix entails the risk of cannibalization of other distribution channels (e.g., purchases of downloads or CDs) and might reduce overall revenues. To date, no research has assessed the effect of streaming services on revenue, and whether cannibalization indeed takes place. Our research fills this void and assesses the impact of free and paid streaming services on music expenditures and on total music industry revenue. To this end, we constructed a research design in which we observed a panel of more than 2500 music consumers repeatedly over more than one year. This approach allows us to eliminate individual-specific unobserved effects that may otherwise confound the identification of a cannibalization effect. Our results show that the adoption of a free streaming service as well as the adoption of a paid streaming service cannibalizes consumers' music expenditures. The net effect of paid streaming services on revenue, however, is clearly net positive. In contrast, the net effect of free streaming services on revenue is only positive for consumers who were relatively inactive before the adoption. On the industry level, our findings suggest that the negative effect of free streaming on industry revenue is offset by the positive effect of paid streaming in the context that we analyze. Hence, in the market that we study and under the assumptions that we make, we estimate that the overall effect of streaming on industry revenue is positive.},

abstract = {A randomized experiment with almost 35 million Pandora listeners enables us to measure the sensitivity of consumers to advertising, an important topic of study in the era of ad-supported digital content provision. The experiment randomized listeners into nine treatment groups, each of which received a different level of audio advertising interrupting their music listening, with the highest treatment group receiving more than twice as many ads as the lowest treatment group. By keeping consistent treatment assignment for 21 months, we are able to measure long-run demand effects, with three times as much ad-load sensitivity as we would have obtained if we had run a month-long experiment. We estimate a demand curve that is strikingly linear, with the number of hours listened decreasing linearly in the number of ads per hour (also known as the price of ad-supported listening). We also show the negative impact on the number of days listened and on the probability of listening at all in the final month. Using an experimental design that separately varies the number of commercial interruptions per hour and the number of ads per commercial interruption, we find that neither makes much difference to listeners beyond their impact on the total number of ads per hour. Lastly, we find that increased ad load causes a significant increase in the number of paid ad-free subscriptions to Pandora, particularly among older listeners.},

We go beyond existing studies and are interested in the role signature features of Web radio play for its listeners. We answer two research questions: (1) What do users expect from listening to Web radio as an interactive medium? (2) What are the gratifications sought when tuning in to Web radio in comparison to offline radio? The research is based on an exploratory online survey among Web radio listeners in Germany. Our findings show that interactive Web radio features play only a minor role for listeners. Instead, they focus on music. When compared to other online media, listening to Web radio is ranked highest among affective gratification items.

We examine the differences in these gratifications between the basic and premium users with data from 374 Spotify users. The results demonstrate that enjoyment, discovering new music, and ubiquity, are the main drivers of the continuance intention. Interestingly, social connectivity has no effect on continuance intention. Furthermore, premium users experience higher levels of enjoyment and ubiquity than the non-paying basic users. Finally, enjoyment is the only predictor of continuance intention among basic users, but has no effect among premium users.},

abstract = {As mobile devices increase in functionality, users perform more tasks when on the move. Spatial audio interfaces offer a solution for eyes-free interaction. However, such interfaces face a number of challenges when supporting multiple and simultaneous tasks, namely: 1) interference amongst multiple audio streams, and 2) the constraints of cognitive load. We present a comparative study of spatial audio techniques evaluated in a divided- and selective-attention task. A podcast was used for high cognitive load (divided-attention) and classical music for low cognitive load (selective-attention), while interacting with an audio menu. Results showed that spatial audio techniques were preferred when cognitive load was kept low, while a baseline technique using an interruptible single audio stream was significantly less preferred. Conversely, when cognitive load was increased the preferences reversed. Thus, given an appropriate task structure, spatial techniques offer a means of designing effective audio interfaces to support eyes-free mobile multitasking. Copyright 2011 ACM.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 IEEE. Music streaming platforms enable people to access millions of tracks using computers and mobile devices. The latter allow users consume different music during different activities. Both, the sheer amount of music and the mobile access to music makes music organization an interesting topic for multimedia researchers. Assisting users to organize their music and make the music they like easily available in the right moment, contributes to increased usability of music streaming platforms. To get a deeper understanding of how users organize music nowadays, we analyze user-created playlists crawled from the music streaming platform Spotify. Using this new data set we find an explanation of differences in the playlists using audio features and based on this compute playlist clusters. We find that 91{\%} of all users create at least one playlist in the "feel good music"-cluster and classical music or rap music can be considered as niche music with respect to the number of playlists, however not as niche music when considering the number of users. To foster research in this field, we make our analysis tool publicly available.},

abstract = {Interactive radio is proposed as a platform for Weiser's calm computing vision. An evaluation of CereProc's MyMyRadio is presented as a case study to highlight the potential and challenges of an interactive radio approach: the difficulty of transitioning between passive and active modes of interaction, and the challenge of designing such services. The evaluation showed: 1) A higher workload for MyMyRadio for active tasks compared to default applications (e.g. Facebook app), 2) No significant difference in workload for passive tasks (e.g. listening to audio rendered RSS updates vs Browser app), 3) A higher workload when listening to music within MyMyRadio vs iTunes, and 4) A preference for RSS feed content compared to content from social media. We conclude by discussing the potential of interactive radio as a platform for pervasive eyes-free services. Copyright is held by the author/owner(s).},

@article{Ren2004,
abstract = {This study explores the Web content of the Internet-based radio stations and the terrestrial radio stations streaming online. It also compares the different strategies adopted by these two groups of Internet radio stations as reflected by their online contents. The websites of 176 stations were analyzed to examine two broad interactive dimensions-audience-oriented and source- oriented-and six strategic patterns (I) virtual information space, (2) virtual promotion space, (3) virtual distribution space, (4) virtual communication space, (5) virtual sponsorship space, and (6) virtual transaction space. The findings indicate that the online presence of information, promotion, and communication was highly visible for both the terrestrial and Internet-based radio stations. However, the terrestrial and Internet-based radio stations had very different means of structuring these functions online. Strategically, the terrestrial radio stations have acted more as information providers, while the Internet-based stations have acted more as the communication facilitators.},

@article{Doherty2013,
abstract = {Enjoyment of audio has now become about flexibility and personal freedom. Digital audio content can be acquired from many sources and wireless networking allows digital media devices and associated peripherals to be unencumbered by wires. However, despite recent improvements in capacity and quality of service, wireless networks are inherently unreliable communications channels for the streaming of audio, being susceptible to the effects of range, interference, and occlusion. This time-varying reliability of wireless audio transfer introduces data corruption and loss, with unpleasant audible effects that can be profound and prolonged in duration. Traditional communications techniques for error mitigation perform poorly and in a bandwidth inefficient manner in the presence of such large-scale defects in a digital audio stream. A novel solution that can complement existing techniques takes account of the semantics and natural repetition of music. Through the use of self-similarity metadata, missing or damaged audio segments can be seamlessly replaced with similar undamaged segments that have already been successfully received. We propose a technology to generate relevant self-similarity metadata for arbitrary audio material and to utilize this metadata within a wireless audio receiver to provide sophisticated and real-time correction of large-scale errors. The primary objectives are to match the current section of a song being received with previous sections while identifying incomplete sections and determining replacements based on previously received portions of the song. This article outlines our approach to Forward Error Correction (FEC) technology that is used to "repair" a bursty dropout when listening to time-dependent media on a wireless network. Using self-similarity analysis on a music file, we can "automatically" repair the dropout with a similar portion of the music already received thereby minimizing a listener's discomfort. {\textcopyright} 2013 ACM.},
